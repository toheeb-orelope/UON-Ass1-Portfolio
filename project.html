                <h2><a href="#">Software Engineering Project</a></h2><br><br>
                <p> During my first year and first semester at the University of Northampton studying Software
                    Engineering, one of the
                    modules focused on imparting the significance of software engineering in real-world scenarios. This
                    encompassed various stages such as problem identification, eliciting characteristics of the problem
                    domain, specifying requirements, conducting system analysis, designing systems, building and testing
                    them, evaluating their performance, implementing them, and ensuring their maintenance. These
                    components constitute the fundamental aspects of software engineering. <br><br>

                    Under the guidance of exceptional lecturers, we were divided into subgroups and tasked with a
                    project aimed at addressing the decline in annual revenue at a zoo, attributed to outdated
                    technology. As the leader of the web development team, I collaborated closely with my team leader.
                    Despite our team's commendable performance, we unfortunately lost the contract due to our higher
                    pricing. Nonetheless, I take immense pride in our team's achievements and the high praise we
                    received from our lecturer, resulting in an A+ grade for my exemplary work ethic and
                    performance.<br><br>

                    I cannot overstate the incredible support provided by our lecturer, both in terms of delivering
                    lectures and offering additional assistance outside the classroom, ensuring that all students were
                    well-equipped for success.</p>

                <h2><a href="#">Web Development</a></h2><br><br>
                <p>
                    In my second semester at the University of Northampton, one of the modules we're undertaking is web
                    development, and I must say, it's an absolutely fantastic module. We're currently engaged in an
                    ongoing project where we're tasked with designing a portfolio using HTML and CSS, and the progress
                    has been smooth sailing thus far. Much credit goes to our exceptional lecturer, who not only
                    possesses an incredible knack for delivering engaging lectures but also works tirelessly to ensure
                    that all his students are well taken care of and supported. His dedication is truly commendable, and
                    it's a privilege to be guided by such an inspiring mentor.
